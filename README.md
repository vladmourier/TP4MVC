# TP4MVC

A school project aimed to practice our mastery of design patterns. It features a screen when turtle agents can move and draw geometrical shapes.
It is written using several design patterns such as the MVC, the Adaptor, or the Template method pattern.
Turtles can also be controlled by the user, who can navigate through the turtles and control each one individually.
